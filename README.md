Web-dev Journey

Hello, that's my web-dev journey, i'd like to become a dev

As a teenager, I spent a lot of time on my computer.
That's when I discovered web developers. From a few lines of code, they make something really beautiful.

So what did I do? I started learning the basics, of HTML5, CSS3, Js, GIT, and Github and currently, I'm learning to code in, MYSQL, Php and how to use api's.

This is my dream, to be a web developer, a full stack developer, to create something nice and accessible for everyone.
 
This is my new lifestyle, trying to become a good developer
